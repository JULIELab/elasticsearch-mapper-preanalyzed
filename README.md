elasticsearch-mapper-preanalyzed
================================

An ElasticSearch mapper plugin that allows to index preanalyzed TokenStreams, i.e. to circumvent an index analyzer in ElasticSearch and instead specifying each token to be indexed separatly.

The current version works with ElasticSearch 0.90.x. An update for ES <= 1.x is to come but should not be expected before end of summer / fall 2014. Of course, contributions are most welcome.
